# Neural-distinguisher

1. This project contains the supporting material of the paper entitled "An Improved Integral distinguisher scheme based on Deep Learning". The paper can be found at https://easychair.org/publications/preprint/9v46

2. For more information, feedback or questions, pleast contact at bzahednezhad@gmail.com

3. These algorithms are implemented by behnam zahednejad, State Key Laboratory of Information Security, Guangzhou university

4.The project implements the integral distingusher on different block ciphers using division prperty (using minizinc tool), and deep learning CNN algorithms namely ResNet, ResNext and DensNet. 

5. The implementation of the key recovery attack on speck block cipher is on the key recovery folder. 


The division property is implemented using minizinc optmization tool which can be found at https://www.minizinc.org
Also to run the deep learning CNN algorithms,  a fast gpu-based enviorment can be found at https://colab.research.google.com
