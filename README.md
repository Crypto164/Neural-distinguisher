# Cryptographic evaluation of IoT with machine learning

All implementations of verification of authentication schemes with machine learning and the symmetric neural distinguisher of IoT block ciphers developed in chapter 4 and 5 of the thesis are available. They are put inside the authentication and distinguisher files, respectively. 

1. "Authentication" file contains all the data set and python codes in analysis of strong authentication, key freshness, key authentication, Unknown Key Share (UKS) and password guessing attack in authentication and key agreement protocols described in chapter 4. 

2. "Distinguisher" file contains the implementations of our NN-based symmetric cipher distinguisher described in chapter 5.
